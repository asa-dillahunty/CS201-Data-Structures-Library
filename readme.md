# CS 201 Data Structures Library
As an individual class assignment, students were tasked with creating a small library of rudimentary data structures and implementing essential algorithms in small steps or phases in C++.


## Phase 1
### Circular Dynamic Array
For the first phase of the assignment, a Circular Dynamic Array was implemented with specifications detailed in the following PDF:
[Phase 1 specs.](Phase1/Phase1.pdf)


## Phase 2
### Left-Leaning Red-Black Trees
For the second phase of the assignment, a Left-Leaning Red-Black Tree was implemented with specifications detailed in the following PDF:
[Phase 2 specs.](Phase2/Phase2.pdf)

Left-leaning trees were chosen because they can easily be converted into 2-3-4 trees.

## Phase 3
### Heaps
For the third phase of the assignment, a Binomial Heap and a standard Binary Heap was implemented. For both, the specifications were detailed in
[Phase 3 specs.](Phase3/Phase3.pdf)

These heaps were implemented using the Circular Dynamic Array from Phase 1.
